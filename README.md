# UPSSITECH
```UPSSITECH``` stands for, in French, ```Universite Paul Sabatier Sciences Technologiques``` that is a Toulsoue-based engineering school.

## Overview.
This is a repo regrouping some of my training home_work during my student engineering school at ```UPSSITECH``` in ```TOULOUSE``` in ```FRANCE```.
They were dispatched and now brought into one.
Each of those directories is a practical work that reinforces a theoritical class.

## Disclaimer
These works are the implementation of my understanding regarding each subject I had and do not all pretend to be correct.
