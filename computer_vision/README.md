This class was about all manipulating some notions about ```Computer Vision```.
* TP1 : [Fourier Transform](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/CompVision/Town%20-%20ComputerVision%20-%20L3.pdf), [Mean squared error](https://encord.com/glossary/mean-square-error-mse/)
* TP2 : [LBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns), [SIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform), [Moravec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_detection) [Hamming Distance](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/4-types-of-distance-metrics-in-machine-learning/)
* TP3 : [Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection),  [Hough Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform)

These are developped in Matlab under Universty Licence and cand ne run with [Octave](https://octave.org) which is an free alternative of Matlab.
